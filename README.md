# Techtitans 💻🕹
Let Us introduce the Tech Titans Projects
*Both Projects Are Based on Arduino Uno

First We Have The Smart Parking Garage 🅿️ :

Components we used: 2 LCDs with i2c, buzzer, Flame sensor,6 IR sensors, Servo motor, Push button, LEDs, LDR Sensor,
Description :
.One LCD display is mounted facing the exterior of the garage, providing information to vehicles entering the garage.

.The other LCD display is positioned inside the garage, conveying information to the user within the garage.

.Two IR sensors are  placed at the garage entrance and exit, one before and one after the gate, to accurately determine the direction of vehicles. These sensors facilitate gate control, allowing the system to differentiate between incoming and outgoing vehicles.

.A servo motor is responsible for controlling the garage gate. It opens and closes in response to vehicle entry and exit.

.Four IR sensors are strategically placed within the garage parking slots to determine the availability of parking spaces. These sensors communicate with the LCD facing the car entering the garage.

.A buzzer is integrated into the system to provide audible alerts and warnings, such as fire detection or security breaches.

.The flame sensor continuously monitors for the presence of fires within the garage. If a fire is detected, it triggers an alarm displays a warning message on the interior LCD, And Keeps The gate Open.

.An emergency button is included in the system. If pressed, it signals a security threat (thief) and activates the buzzer and gate closure.

.LED lights are installed within the garage for illumination and an LDR continuously monitors ambient light conditions, If it is dark, the LDR signals the LED lights to turn on, ensuring adequate lighting within the garage, and In daylight or well-lit conditions, the LDR signals the LEDs to turn off, saving energy and electricity.




Second We have Maze-Solver & Bluetooth Car AKA "AZZA" 🚗:
